# FordGoBike User-Group Analysis
## by Jochen Zanker


## Dataset

The dataset originates from FordGoBike and contains data of around 2.38 million individual rides. The data covers the time span of June 2017 to December 2018. The dataset includes station names, the user type (subscriber or casual user), gender, user’s year of birth, trip duration, start and end time-stamps, start and end stations coordinates/names, as well as bikes and stations IDs. Each row represents a single ride. This set of attributes allows to base the analysis to the action of a ride. Limitation: A basis on the entity of the user is not possible. The dataset contains "ride-related" and anonymized data only, and includes the following dimensions and metrics:

- Trip Duration (seconds)
- Start Time and Date
- End Time and Date
- Start Station ID
- Start Station Name
- Start Station Latitude
- Start Station Longitude
- End Station ID
- End Station Name
- End Station Latitude
- End Station Longitude
- Bike ID
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual)
- Member Year of Birth
- Member Gender
